LDNDC Notes


winter rye	WINTERRYE	
food corn	FOCO	
spring wheat	SPWH	
Glycine Max	SOYB	
cowpea	COWP	legume cover crops?
Brassica Napus (spring)	SRAPE	brassica cover crops?
Gossipium Hirsutum	COTT	
Pigeonpea	PIGE	
Raphanus Sativus	RADI	brassica cover crops?


fertilizer conversion is factor of 10, so 2.2 g m2 is 22 kg N/ha
ldndc fertilizer units - kg N/ha
daycent fert units - 6.5 g N m-2 


Need to get from LDNDC
1.Yield - harvest file - dC_frt[kgCha-1]
2.SOC - soil chemistry file - C_soil_total[kgCha-1]
3.N2O emissions - soil chemistry file - dN2O_emis[kgNha-1]
4.CH4 emissions - soil chemistry file - dC_ch4_emis[kgCha-1]

5.CO2 respiration - soil chemistry file - dC_co2_emis_hetero[kgCha-1]

6.CO2 emissions - soil chemistry file -dC_co2_emis_auto[kgCha-1]	dC_co2_emis_hetero[kgCha-1] ???


assumptions in LDNDC
event file - planting cover crop, just add a row for each new cover crop
only one till event
TODO add tilling event to daycent wheat before tillage?
cowpeas for legume?

# TODO debug LDNDC wheat
# figure out why Maize has no yield
# add units to crop annual output field
# run different GEOID than Nebraska, see what corn does
