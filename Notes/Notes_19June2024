is harvesting a cover crop the only way to plant a new crop in LDNDC?

LDNDC goes to 1 m while Daycent goes to 25cm. So how to apply this to Millenium? Ellen
had code that would reduce the SOC amount depending on the scenario. I am not sure if this
is because of emprics? 

How was ellen getting crop yield in Millenial?

Do we want add daily microbial CO2 ?


TODOS

data exploration
-something to show that output data is there
  -table with counties and number of files per model
  
-input soils boxplots and histograms
-input climate boxplots and histograms

-output ghg boxplots, histograms, line graphs, maps

create document about model running

-check on LDNDC scenario 5

# TODO start working on collating results for model output vis
