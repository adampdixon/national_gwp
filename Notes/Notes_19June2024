is harvesting a cover crop the only way to plant a new crop in LDNDC?

LDNDC goes to 1 m while Daycent goes to 25cm. So how to apply this to Millenium? Ellen
had code that would reduce the SOC amount depending on the scenario. I am not sure if this
is because of emprics? 

How was ellen getting crop yield in Millenial?

Do we want add daily microbial CO2 ?
