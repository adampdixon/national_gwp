Open questions

->What do the scenarios and managment numbers represent?
->Which daycent version are we running? (can I swap out Daycent files if I find some are corrupted?)
->Note that I had to change the BIL limit in soils to be positive because its a negative and need to take log -Line 962_Create_soil_data
->Note replaced NULL value with 'NA' 3_Create_management_input_files-LDNDC_.R line 83
    -also line 112 NULL->-9999

Target is to make sure everything is in one place -
-These are all the scenarios that will be in play
-

Daycent version is in the presentation
