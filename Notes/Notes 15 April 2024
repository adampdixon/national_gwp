Can wheat have cover crops growing when planted?

Go through cover crops available in LDNDC (cowpea, rapeseed, winterrye)

What is DUL and LL15 in the soil file? It appears to be messing up root_system at year 2022, for just wheat

Get Cotton running

just a soil decomposition model,
take plant input, soil temp and mosture, and Mill will make soil carbon
for input take average input for Daycent and LDNDC, inputs are averaged, then Mill spits out soil carbon, soil temperature and soil moisture


think about writing a simple manual of what you did
explain each derecho folder system
how each thing runs
technically guiding this is what I did
so that it's reproducible

TODO
figure out waht DUL and LL15 are in the soil file, also wcmin/max
make histogram of values
