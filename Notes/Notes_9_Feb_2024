Talking with Debjani, Feb 16 

do a x axis with time
then do an average for all counties, or plot all lines

what is the final 2050 value?


check out Ellen's figures

how are the scenarios changing different carbon value
is one scenario carbon neutral

how does it change from the baseline

compare with gNATSGO with full soil profile

change units to Mg ha

check out USDA carbon and yield



Yield
SOC - get from 0-30, 0-100, 0-200
CO2 flux - (check to see if we're getting it from the top 
Methane flux - 
Nitrous Oxide - 

things that are important, so put them in your output
soil temperature moisture
soil nitrogen - nitrogen ammonium
total nitrogen if you can get easy

send doc for LDNDC

send average from 0-30 so Debjani can see

top 30cm. then whole profile

she'll probalby ask to combine the fluxes from top 30 cm

flux units will be per time. per time. 
stock - mass per area
flux - mass per area per time (per day is best)

to do the global warming potential - look and see how ellen calculated accumulated emission. so you'll get the sum
accumulated methane over time,
accumulated carbon over time,
then you'll get the final stock.
