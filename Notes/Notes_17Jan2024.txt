Notes from meeting with Debjani, Jan 17 2024


1. get cotton in there
2. superimpose with CDL
3. Not inhereting KBS properties, and so it's representative of CONUS
4. Make sure it's in the range of of the current field - check the papers
https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168881822.23298383
5. Compare with gSSURGO, and paper, (the paper lumped everything from 1900s to 2000s)
6. limit SOC calc to 4 crops
7. Important to make sure we're in the ballpark
8. Tillage/Cover crops/crop rotation/types of cover crop/tillage+cover crop
9. Also need to see how much nitrogen fertizilier and how adding soybeans changes nitrogen needs and nitrous oxides'
-any scenario we do needs to be meaningful


crop layers/scenarios/-- how I am inputting the data, then we ll talk about LDNDC


From 2 models, 
1. baseline scenario -- 

removed all calibration input files, commented out unnecessary code that was used for comparision, 
got bulk density from SSURGO and soil_df

created new schedule file for corn only, removed unneccessray Daycent runs

spinup daycent run using same info for all counties


How about we start with no-till + corn/wheat/soy/cotton and no-till + corn/wheat/soy/cotton + cover crop? We can build on other scenarios once we figure out these two. Does that sound reasonable?


use summary of whole county for soil?
What about write script where we select 10 locations in cropland in each county and then average that



26 Jan
Make sure day on glade is secure, review 
fertilizer scenarios 50% and 25%,
then no till and cover crop
residue remove - do 25% and 50%

do nothing first. then, think about doing the below.
address planting schedule very ballpark way, maybe march, april, may planting, latitude gradient, think about it in this way.
maybe through an agroecological gradient. agroclimate zone.

look for county summaryized soil data

start with LDNDC
