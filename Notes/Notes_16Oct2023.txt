Start up meeting with Debjani

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17OCpPGuuYr17QBDQ8PYDmT90eYScAZ8m

go through source codes

LDNCD
Millennial
Daycent

Dno't worry about APSIM, RothC

You should be able to find online info on each of the models - each model has a person in charge that is repsponsible for answering questions

Daycent - what are dependencies, what are input files, etc. how do you write output, technically how to run the model

Feel free to reach out to UCAR -- go through their documentation.
You can respond to the same thread. I need to be under Debjani's project.

Get set up with userID, 2 factor auth, having access to other input files. Where they are located and what has been done - so look and see what's been done.

look at soils, and inputs

let Debjani know if I have any questions. Check in again mid-week or end of week.

Once I have access to everything, aware of scripts, once user of database you can join training sessions, etc. but they have very good documentation.


We really want to find out if it's possible to find Net Zero emissions using one or many crop/mgmt practices. This is the goal. 

There are 3 different models. If you can put together flow diagrams, Debjani can help with explaining. Don't worry about what the equations are doing, just what is connected. What are the flows, inputs, outputs. 



second step, will be to run the functions for several counties. Then to adapt the functions so that we can run all the counties.

With questions - just reach out - any time of the day.

Put time management in same. MAke sure you have full access to NCAR system. Email them and have them add to the project and ownership.

Do in this order
1.Daycent - much more local, more information
2.Millenial - it's much more easy (just a decomposition module)
3. LDNDC - do last - tons of papers

Counties in mind -- Debjani will send

Don't worry about removing something, just use all counties, and go from there.

Go with process that helps you expedite. If you want to use all crop layers, etc, what you want to do.


There's two sites, KBS and another one. Just focus on one of them. Focus on the COMET farm version. Clone it in your github and

Talking with Debjani 6 November 2023

-starting to work through Ellen Maas's code
    - seems to make sense
    -

Make sure you get Ellen's files on CISL

in the model we'll change crop percentage according to what percentage county is
we'll try to make as simple as possible
goal is to get a bigger view than fine resolution, go away from that 

will I use all the same scenarios as Ellen
dates will be very approximate

Ellen did a deep dive for KBS, but we'll abstract a lot and make a lot of assumptions at the county level

Generally what is the sowing date? e.g.

Model is calibrated going back in time - pre-history to 2022 - then projected from 2022 to 2050
again we can' fit according to the details

NASS - county level yield data
Soil Carbon data and yield to get started. Then we'll follow up in the future scenarios.
This is first bet to run at national scale, then we'll see if we need to do more targeted calibration

LTER KBS, LRF (in Texas) we can check according to those

If you don't hear back from CISL, the ticket is in the system.


Milennial is just a soil model and is easy - take 2 hours to read through it

temperature/soil moisture -

After DayCent 

Run the point scale model -\\ ?? what does this mean? dfdfdf
