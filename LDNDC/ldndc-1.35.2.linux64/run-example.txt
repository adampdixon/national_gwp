## Run LandscapeDNDC from the command line from within
## the base folder of the archive you received as follows:
##
## For the command line examples here, we assume that the
## directory "a_forest_site" contains a valid LandscapeDNDC
## project with an according project file "a_forest_site.xml".

on Unix or MAC OS X platforms:

$> ./bin/ldndc -c ldndc.conf projects/forest/a_forest/a_forest.ldndc


on Windows platforms:

$> .\bin\ldndc -c ldndc.conf projects\forest\a_forest\a_forest.ldndc


general synopsis:

        ldndc [options] <project file>



## [Note: jLDNDC may not be present in your package]
## Alternatively, you may use jLDNDC which is a very basic
## graphical user interface written in Java for loading and
## executing a valid LandscapeDNDC project. For this to
## work you will need to copy the file "ldndc.conf" to
## your personal LandscapeDNDC configuration folder:

on Unix or MAC OS X platforms:

$> mkdir ~/.ldndc && cp ldndc.conf ~/.ldndc


on Windows platforms:

$> mkdir %userprofile%\.ldndc
$> copy ldndc.conf %userprofile%\.ldndc


## If a configuration file is already present, make sure
## the settings do not conflict. If input base paths
## differ and you still want to run the example projects,
## we suggest you move the examples to the input base
## path configured in your existing configuration file,
## accordingly.

After this step double click on "jldndc.sh" on Unix or
MAC OS X platforms, "jldndc.bat" on Windows platforms.
