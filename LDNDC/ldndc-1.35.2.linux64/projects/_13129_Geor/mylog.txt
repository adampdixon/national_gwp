Error: "Failed to read project file"

==== HELP =============================================
Rats! What happened now? See below for possible
explainations (You'll also find more detailed inform-
ation in the LandscapeDNDC Users Guide v1.35.2) 

The attempt to find and read the project file
failed. This can have several reasons:
    a) The project file does not exist
    b) The project file is spelled incorrectly
    c) The project file contains syntax errors
    d) You have insufficient read permissions
Please, check your project file. Consider using
an XML editor with syntax highlighting
and an XML validator (e.g., xmllint).
