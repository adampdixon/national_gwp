Notes to data processing

All Connecticut county GEOIDs were changed back to historic county GEOIDs rather than their current planning GEOID.

Keenesaw county Michigan was deleted because there were no crops grown there and there was not climate data provided by Zhounan.

This makes CONUS counties number 3,107

Climate data was also missing from three counties. These climate data were replaced by proximate counties with likely similar data. Data from copied county was replaced with GEOID of the missing data county.

Aransas County, TX -> Calhoun county, TX
Island County, WA -> Kitsap county, WA
Barnstable County, MA -> Nantucket county, MA


e.g.
f<-list.files("/glade/work/apdixon/climate", pattern = "35035)

for (i in 1:length(f)){
  print(paste0("copying ", f[i]))
  newfile<-paste0("/glade/work/apdixon/climate/", substr(basename(f[i]), 1, 4), "_53029_", substr(f[i], nchar(f[i])-8, nchar(f[i])))
  file.copy(f[i], newfile)
  print(newfile)
}
