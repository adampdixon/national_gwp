One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.18 lbs N/A (54.09 kg N/ha) was applied. The goal was to apply the nitrogen fertilizer at 3/5 (0.60) rate of the total amount applied to treatments 1 and 2. The protocol was to apply a total amount of 80 lbs N/A for treatments 1 and 2. We applied 32 lbs N/A in the autumn of 2003 so we were trying to apply another 48 lbs N/A in the spring of 2004 on treatments 1 and 2. The 3/5 rate of nitrogen applied to treatment 3 was based on the total annual amount, spring and fall amounts, of nitrogen, not just 3/5 of the nitrogen applied in the spring. Therefore, treatment 3 needed to receive to same amount of nitrogen in the spring as treatments 1 and 2 received, 80 lbs N/A * 0.60 = 48 lbs N/A. Treatment 3 did not receive any nitrogen in 2003. Weather Conditions: Mostly sunny with air temperature ranging from 77-79 degrees F. Relative Humidity was ranging from 30-37%. Wind was out of the west-southwest at 0-8 mph's averaging 3 mph's.

Applied 28% nitrogen solution (28-0-0) at 16 gals/acre (150L/ha) to all replications of treatment 3 on the LTER main site winter wheat, (reps 6, 1, 3, 2, 4, & 5). Average height of the wheat was 2-3 inches. Total amount of fertilizer applied was 239 gals on 14.82 acres (6 hectares). One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.18 lbs N/A (54.09 kg N/ha) was applied. The goal was to apply the nitrogen fertilizer at 3/5 (0.60) rate of the total amount applied to treatments 1 and 2. The protocol was to apply a total amount of 80 lbs N/A for treatments 1 and 2. We applied 32 lbs N/A in the autumn of 2003 so we were trying to apply another 48 lbs N/A in the spring of 2004 on treatments 1 and 2. The 3/5 rate of nitrogen applied to treatment 3 was based on the total annual amount, spring and fall amounts, of nitrogen, not just 3/5 of the nitrogen applied in the spring. Therefore, treatment 3 needed to receive to same amount of nitrogen in the spring as treatments 1 and 2 received, 80 lbs N/A * 0.60 = 48 lbs N/A. Treatment 3 did not receive any nitrogen in 2003.
