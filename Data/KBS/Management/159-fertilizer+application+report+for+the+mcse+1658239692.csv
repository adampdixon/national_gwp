Applied 28% nitrogen solution (28-0-0) at 16 gals/acre (150L/ha) to all replications of treatment 3 on the LTER main site winter wheat, (reps 6, 1, 3, 2, 4, & 5). Average height of the wheat was 2-3 inches. Total amount of fertilizer applied was 239 gals on 14.82 acres (6 hectares). One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.18 lbs N/A (54.09 kg N/ha) was applied. The goal was to apply the nitrogen fertilizer at 3/5 (0.60) rate of the total amount applied to treatments 1 and 2. The protocol was to apply a total amount of 80 lbs N/A for treatments 1 and 2. We applied 32 lbs N/A in the autumn of 2003 so we were trying to apply another 48 lbs N/A in the spring of 2004 on treatments 1 and 2. The 3/5 rate of nitrogen applied to treatment 3 was based on the total annual amount, spring and fall amounts, of nitrogen, not just 3/5 of the nitrogen applied in the spring. Therefore, treatment 3 needed to receive to same amount of nitrogen in the spring as treatments 1 and 2 received, 80 lbs N/A * 0.60 = 48 lbs N/A. Treatment 3 did not receive any nitrogen in 2003. Weather Conditions: Mostly sunny with air temperature ranging from 77-79 degrees F. Relative Humidity was ranging from 30-37%. Wind was out of the west-southwest at 0-8 mph's averaging 3 mph's.

Applied 28% nitrogen solution (28-0-0) at 16 gals/acre (150L/ha) to all replications of treatment 3 on the LTER main site winter wheat, (reps 6, 1, 3, 2, 4, & 5). Average height of the wheat was 2-3 inches. Total amount of fertilizer applied was 239 gals on 14.82 acres (6 hectares). One gallon of 28% fertilizer weighs 10.67 lbs. 48.18 lbs N/A (54.09 kg N/ha) was applied. The goal was to apply the nitrogen fertilizer at 3/5 (0.60) rate of the total amount applied to treatments 1 and 2. The protocol was to apply a total amount of 80 lbs N/A for treatments 1 and 2. We applied 32 lbs N/A in the autumn of 2003 so we were trying to apply another 48 lbs N/A in the spring of 2004 on treatments 1 and 2. The 3/5 rate of nitrogen applied to treatment 3 was based on the total annual amount, spring and fall amounts, of nitrogen, not just 3/5 of the nitrogen applied in the spring. Therefore, treatment 3 needed to receive to same amount of nitrogen in the spring as treatments 1 and 2 received, 80 lbs N/A * 0.60 = 48 lbs N/A. Treatment 3 did not receive any nitrogen in 2003. Weather Conditions: Mostly sunny with air temperature ranging from 77-79 degrees F. Relative Humidity was ranging from 30-37%. Wind was out of the west-southwest at 0-8 mph's averaging 3 mph's. Time of application was between 4:00 p.m. and 5:45 p.m. Equipment Used: JD 5220 tractor traveling 5.0-6.0 mph (gear C1, 1600-1800 rpm's) with a pull type Top Air sprayer equipped with a hydraulic centrifugal sprayer pump and a Raven 440 automatic carrier control unit.

The 230 lbs/A provided 138 lbs/A K2O to the plots. This is designed to be the first half of a two part application to reach 460 lbs/A of potash. The fertilizer was applied with the JD 7420(a) tractor traveling at approximately 2.3 mph and Gandy Orbit-Air fertilizer applicator with a 30 ft boom, connected to a Raven 6000 monitor which controlled and monitored the application. For the Gandy/Raven set-up, the following were used: Density 70 lbs/cu ft; metering wheel 1 1/4” diameter (yellow); deflector spacing 22”; meter cal number 199; air pressure was 12 p.s.i.

Actual amounts applied on the 15 acres (6 ha) were 3,920 lbs (1,782 kg) of 0-46-0, 5,990 lbs (2,723 kg) of 0-0-62, and 50 lbs (22.7 kg) of boron. The fertilizers were blended together and applied at the same time. The fertilizer was applied with a JD 7400 tractor, C3 1700 rpm, around 6-7 mph, and a Willmar 6 ton pull type spinner spreader. With a spinner spreader it would have been difficult to spread, in one pass, the entire amount of fertilizer recommended. The pattern of the fertilizer coming out of the spreader may not be a uniform pattern at such a high rate of fertilizer per acre therefore; I split the application rate in half then drove over the plots twice. The driving intervals were based on a 40 ft spreading pattern. The second time over the plots I drove between the first set of driving intervals. After spreading fertilizer on all six replications I had some fertilizer remaining in the spreader (about 1,992 lbs) so I applied the remaining fertilizer onto replications 1, 2, and 5, i.e. I did not change the setting on the fertilizer spreader and I went over reps 1, 2, and 5 for a third time. Replications 1, 2, and 5 had the lowest amount of P and K in the soil, i.e. the highest fertilizer recommendations was for reps 1, 2, and 5. Actual amounts applied to replications 1, 2, and 5 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 2,352 lbs (1,069 kg) of 0-46-0, 3,594 lbs (1,634 kg) of 0-0-62, and 30 lbs (13.64 kg) of boron. In replications 1, 2, and 5 the 314 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 144 lbs/A (161.7 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 479 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 297 lbs/A (333 kg/ha) of K2O. The 30 lbs of boron provided 4 lbs/A (4.5 kg/ha) of boron. Actual amounts applied to replications 3, 4, and 6 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 1,568 lbs (713 kg) of 0-46-0, 2,396 lbs (1,089 kg) of 0-0-62, and 20 lbs (9 kg) of boron. In replications 3, 4, and 6 the 209 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 96 lbs/A (107.8 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 319 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 198 lbs/A (222 kg/ha) of K2O.

The fertilizers were blended together and applied at the same time. The fertilizer was applied with a JD 7400 tractor, C3 1700 rpm, around 6-7 mph, and a Willmar 6 ton pull type spinner spreader. With a spinner spreader it would have been difficult to spread, in one pass, the entire amount of fertilizer recommended. The pattern of the fertilizer coming out of the spreader may not be a uniform pattern at such a high rate of fertilizer per acre therefore; I split the application rate in half then drove over the plots twice. The driving intervals were based on a 40 ft spreading pattern. The second time over the plots I drove between the first set of driving intervals. After spreading fertilizer on all six replications I had some fertilizer remaining in the spreader (about 1,992 lbs) so I applied the remaining fertilizer onto replications 1, 2, and 5, i.e. I did not change the setting on the fertilizer spreader and I went over reps 1, 2, and 5 for a third time. Replications 1, 2, and 5 had the lowest amount of P and K in the soil, i.e. the highest fertilizer recommendations was for reps 1, 2, and 5. Actual amounts applied to replications 1, 2, and 5 (7.5 acres, 3 ha) was 2,352 lbs (1,069 kg) of 0-46-0, 3,594 lbs (1,634 kg) of 0-0-62, and 30 lbs (13.64 kg) of boron. In replications 1, 2, and 5 the 314 lbs/A of 0-46-0 provided 144 lbs/A (161.7 kg/ha) of P2O5. The 479 lbs/A of 0-0-62 provided 297 lbs/A (333 kg/ha) of K2O. The 30 lbs of boron provided 4 lbs/A (4.5 kg/ha) of boron.

Equipment used: JD7420b tractor and the 6 row fertilizer applicator equipped with a John Deere Rate Controller and an Ace pump, The 28% applicator has seven coulters where the 5 inside coulters apply a full target rate and the 2 outside coulters apply half of the target rate. The applicator is controlled by a rate controller as well as inline orifices. Weather conditions at the start 2:15 p.m. sunny, 70.8 degrees F, 8-9 mph west winds, 42.7% humidity.

Dekalb DKC52-84 RIB has a relative maturity of 102 days (2550 growing degree units to black layer). DKC52-84A RIB is Roundup Ready Genuity Smartstax RIB (refuge in a bag) corn blend. 

Applied 19-17-0 liquid fertilizer at 14.0 gallons/acre. 

14 gals/A of 19-17-0 supplies 29.22 lbs N/A and 26.14 lbs P205/A.

The fertilizer was placed two inches to the side and two inches below the seed at planting.
