Ecological Site Concept
This site occurs on very deep, gently sloping clay loam soils on uplands. Although the soils are deep and well drained, the nature of the clay soils can cause the site to be particularly sensitive to dry conditions. The reference vegetation consists of shortgrasses with some midgrasses and few forbs. Abusive grazing practices may lead to the suppression of palatable species and a shift in the plant community. Without periodic fire or alternative brush management, woody species may encroach on the site.

Soil Features
This site consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loam and clay loam loess deposits. These are very well developed soils on old stable landforms and are moderately alkaline throughout. The soils have dark colored loam or clay loam surfaces and clay loam subsurface layers. Permeability is moderate, and available water holding capacity is moderate to high. The fertility of these soils is high and the root zone is easily penetrated by plant roots so the production capacity is high. These sites are subject to wind erosion if suitable cover is not present. Major Soil Taxonomic Units correlated to this site include: Acuff loam, Estacado clay loam, Friona loam, Mansker clay loam, Olton clay loam, Pantex silty clay loam, Pullman clay loam, Tulia loam, and Zita loam. 

Reference Community
The interpretive or ""reference"" plant community for this site is a shortgrass dominated community with blue grama being the dominant grass with lesser amounts of buffalograss (average of 60 - 70 percent blue grama and 15 - 25 percent buffalograss). There are a few other species of shortgrasses present making up from 5 to 10 percent of total production. Western wheatgrass and vine mesquite are often present in depressions and on slopes above playa lakes. There are approximately 5 percent forbs and almost no woody shrubs or trees present.
